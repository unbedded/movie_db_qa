```python
# Capture screenshot on test failure (including xfail tests to show actual bug state)
if hasattr(request.node, "rep_call"):
    # Capture for both unexpected failures and expected failures (xfail)
    # xfail screenshots demonstrate the actual defect behavior
    if request.node.rep_call.failed or (
        hasattr(request.node.rep_call, "wasxfail") and request.node.rep_call.wasxfail
    ):
        screenshot_name = f"{request.node.name}_{request.node.rep_call.when}.png"
        screenshot_path = SCREENSHOT_DIR / screenshot_name
        status = "xfail" if hasattr(request.node.rep_call, "wasxfail") else "failed"
        logger.info("Test %s - capturing screenshot: %s", status, screenshot_path)
        page.screenshot(path=str(screenshot_path))
```

**Key improvements:**
