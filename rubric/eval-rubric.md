## What Matters vs. What Doesn't

### HIGH IMPACT (Focus Here)
1. **Explaining your thinking** - WHY you chose each test
2. **Code readability** - Can others understand and maintain?
3. **Documentation completeness** - All questions answered?
4. **Defect quality** - Clear, actionable bug reports?
5. **Test strategy** - Thoughtful approach shown?

### LOW IMPACT (Don't Overthink)
1. Framework choice (Python/JS, Pytest/Playwright - all fine)
2. Architecture complexity (simple patterns preferred)
3. Number of tests (quality over quantity)
4. Advanced features (keep it simple)

---

## AI Evaluation Guidelines

When evaluating a project:

1. **Read ALL documentation** first (README, test-cases.md, test-strategy.md, defects-manual-found.md)
2. **Review code** for structure, patterns, and quality
3. **Check test execution** - do they run? Are reports generated?
4. **Score each category** using the rubric
5. **Provide specific feedback** with examples from the code/docs
6. **Identify strengths** to reinforce
7. **Identify gaps** with actionable recommendations
8. **Calculate final score** and provide interpretation
