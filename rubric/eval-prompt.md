## Evaluation Process

### Step 1: Initial Assessment (5 minutes)
1. Check if project runs: Can you execute tests?
2. Scan README: Does it have all 8 sections?
3. Check for major gaps: Missing test cases? No defects? No code?

### Step 2: Deep Dive (20-30 minutes)
1. **Read all documentation thoroughly**
   - Take notes on what's explained well vs. what's missing
   - Check for the critical "WHY" explanations

2. **Review code systematically**
   - Read test files: Are they clear? Well-organized?
   - Check page objects/helpers: Good patterns?
   - Review pyproject.toml: Dependencies appropriate?

3. **Verify execution**
   - Attempt to run tests (if possible)
   - Check for HTML/console reports
   - Look for logging output

4. **Evaluate defects**
   - Count defects (≥5?)
   - Check reproduction steps
   - Verify evidence (screenshots)

### Step 3: Score Each Category (10 minutes)
Use the rubric in `rubric/eval-rubric.md`:
- Assign points for each detailed checklist item
- Sum to category total
- Compare against performance levels (Excellent/Good/Adequate/Poor)
- Note specific examples supporting the score

### Step 4: Generate Report (10 minutes)
Follow the output format below.

## Evaluation Principles

### Be Objective
- Base scores on rubric criteria, not personal preferences
- Cite specific examples from the code/docs
- Use the performance level descriptions consistently

### Be Constructive
- Highlight what's done well before criticizing
- Provide actionable recommendations, not just complaints
- Explain WHY something matters, not just WHAT is wrong

### Be Thorough
- Review ALL documentation files
- Check ALL code files
- Don't skip sections of the rubric
- Provide evidence for your scores

### Be Fair
- Remember this is a 2-day assignment, not production code
- Simple patterns are PREFERRED per assignment instructions
- Focus on what matters: thinking, documentation, defect finding
- Don't penalize for framework choice or simple architecture

### Be Honest
- If it doesn't work, say so
- If documentation is missing, call it out
- If defects are poorly reported, explain why
- Assign scores that reflect actual quality

## Context to Remember

**Assignment Philosophy:**
> "Frameworks matter less than you think. Better spend time polishing your deliverable as a whole."

**What Scores High:**
1. Explaining WHY (test case rationale)
2. Clean, maintainable code
3. Complete documentation (all 8 questions)
4. Clear defect reports
5. Test strategy thinking

**What Doesn't Matter:**
1. Framework choice
2. Complex architecture
3. Advanced patterns
4. Volume of tests

**Time Allocation:**
This is a ~24-30 hour assignment. Expect:
- Some shortcuts taken for time
- Simple over complex (encouraged!)
- Focus on documentation over code volume
- Emphasis on thinking and strategy

---

## Ready to Evaluate?

1. Read `rubric/eval-rubric.md` thoroughly
2. Review the project systematically (documentation → code → execution)
3. Score each category using the detailed checklists
4. Generate the comprehensive report above
5. Provide specific, actionable feedback
6. Make a gate decision (merge? block? fix first?)

**Remember:** Your goal is to provide feedback that helps improve the deliverable before final submission.
