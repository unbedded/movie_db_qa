## üü° IMPORTANT - But Keep Simple

### 5. Working Test Suite
- Must run successfully
- HTML + Console reports
- Browser API validation
- Logging implementation

**Action:**

- Simple logging (console.log or logger lib)
- Basic API interception
- Keep it simple!

**Time:** Included in coding time

---

### 6. CI Integration Strategy (5% of score)
- Document approach (DON'T implement)
- Show understanding of CI/CD

**Action:**
- Write 1-2 page doc on CI approach
- Tools, pipeline, triggers
- Can be in README or separate doc

**Time:** 2-3 hours

---

## üü¢ LOW PRIORITY - Don't Overthink

### Framework Selection
**Assignment says:** "Frameworks matter less than you think"

**Action:**
- Pick what you know best
- 30 min decision MAX
- Playwright/Cypress/Selenium - all fine
- TypeScript/JavaScript/Python - all fine

**Time:** 30 min - 2 hours total for setup

---

### Architecture Complexity
**They're NOT looking for:**
- Complex patterns
- Over-engineering
- Fancy architecture

**Action:**
- Keep it simple
- 1-2 page objects
- Basic helpers
- That's it!

## üìä Evaluation Criteria (What They're Judging)

### Primary Evaluation
1. **Testing mindset** - Do you think like a QA?
2. **Communication** - Can you explain your work?
3. **Code quality** - Is it maintainable?
4. **Completeness** - Did you deliver everything?

### NOT Evaluated On
1. Framework expertise
2. Complex implementations
3. Advanced techniques
4. Latest technologies

---

## üéØ The Bottom Line

**What scores high:**
- Clear thinking + documentation of WHY
- Clean, working code
- Finding real defects
- Complete deliverables
- Professional presentation

**What doesn't matter:**
- Which tools you use
- How complex your setup is
- Advanced patterns
- Fancy features

## üí° Quick Decision Guide

### Stuck on a decision? Ask:
1. **Will this help me explain my thinking?** ‚Üí Yes = Do it
2. **Will this make code cleaner?** ‚Üí Yes = Do it
3. **Is this required in deliverables?** ‚Üí Yes = Do it
4. **Is this just cool/fancy?** ‚Üí No = Skip it

### Time check: Ask yourself
- "Am I over-engineering this?"
- "Will this help me score higher?"
- "Is this in the requirements?"

**Remember:** Less is more when it's clean, clear, and complete.
