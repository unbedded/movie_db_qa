## 1. Framework & Technology Selection

### Decision: Python 3.13 + Pytest

**Rationale:** Most expeditious choice for rapid test development with professional quality gates

| Component | Library | Version | Purpose | Implementation |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|----------------|
| Test Framework | pytest | ≥7.0 | Test runner and framework | `pyproject.toml` |
| Coverage | pytest-cov | ≥4.0 | Branch coverage reporting | `pyproject.toml` + `Makefile` |
| HTML Reports | pytest-html | ≥1.0 | Test result reports | `pyproject.toml` |
| Browser Automation | **playwright** | ≥1.40 | **Web UI testing** | **`pyproject.toml`** |
| Linter | ruff | ≥0.1.0 | Fast all-in-one linter | `.pre-commit-config.yaml` |
| Type Checker | mypy | ≥1.0 | Static type checking | `.pre-commit-config.yaml` |
| Formatter | black | ≥23.0 | Code formatting | `.pre-commit-config.yaml` |
| Git Hooks | pre-commit | ≥3.0 | Quality gates | `.pre-commit-config.yaml` |

**Browser Automation: Playwright vs Selenium Decision**

| Factor | Playwright | Selenium | Winner |
|--------|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Speed** | Faster (auto-waits, parallel) | Slower (explicit waits) | ✅ Playwright |
| **Modern SPA support** | Excellent (built for React/Vue) | Good (requires more config) | ✅ Playwright |
| **Network mocking/interception** | Built-in | Requires proxy/extensions | ✅ Playwright |
| **API testing** | Integrated | Separate tools needed | ✅ Playwright |
| **Setup** | `pip install playwright` + `playwright install` | `pip install selenium` + driver management | ✅ Playwright |
| **Learning curve** | Modern, intuitive API | Legacy patterns | ✅ Playwright |
| **Maintenance** | Auto-updates browsers | Driver version hell | ✅ Playwright |
| **Python typing** | Excellent | Limited | ✅ Playwright |
| **TMDB site fit** | Perfect (SPA, dynamic content) | Works but requires more code | ✅ Playwright |

**Decision: Playwright ✅**

**Rationale:**
- **Starting fresh** - No legacy Selenium tests to maintain
- **Modern SPA** - TMDB is React/Vue with dynamic content, Playwright handles better
- **Speed** - Faster execution = faster feedback loop (critical for 2-day assignment)
- **Network validation** - Built-in API interception for backend testing (assignment requirement)
- **Less maintenance** - Auto-wait, auto-browser updates, better error messages
- **Team expertise** - Python team, Playwright has superior Python support

**Alternatives Rejected:**

| Option | Why Rejected |
|--------|--------------|
| Selenium | Older API, driver management overhead, slower for SPAs |
| Cypress | JavaScript-only, not Python ecosystem |
| Puppeteer | JavaScript-only, Chrome-focused |
| Both Selenium + Playwright | Unnecessary complexity, doubles maintenance |

**Implementation:**
```python
# pyproject.toml
dev = [
    "playwright>=1.40",
    "pytest-playwright>=0.4",
]

# Install browsers
playwright install chromium
```

**Outcome:** ✅ Delivered v0.2.0 framework in Phase 1 with full CI/CD pipeline

---

## 2. Version Control Strategy

### Decision: Git-flow Branching Model
**Rationale:**
- **Professional workflow:** Separate feature branches → develop → main release flow
- **Quality gates:** Each merge requires passing tests and code review
- **Release management:** Clean release history with semantic versioning
- **Assignment alignment:** Demonstrates understanding of professional development practices

**Branch Structure:**
```
main              # Production releases (v0.2.0, v1.0.0, etc.)
develop           # Integration branch
feature/*         # Feature development branches
  feature/test-design
  feature/test-implementation
  feature/defect-reporting
  feature/documentation
  feature/ci-enhancements
  feature/polish
```

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Trunk-based development:** Simpler, but less clear separation of work phases
- **GitHub flow:** Simpler than git-flow, but wanted to show full release management

**Trade-offs Accepted:**
- More complex than simple main-branch workflow
- Requires discipline in merging and branch management
- Worth it for demonstrating professional practices

---

## 3. Test Design Strategy

### Decision: Risk-Based + Design Techniques Approach

**Rationale:** "Which cases did you generate and WHY?" - Assignment requires clear prioritization and formal test design

**Priority Framework:**

| Priority | Features | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Critical | Core filters (Popular, Trending, Newest, Top Rated) | Primary user workflows |
| High | Pagination, Search, Type filters | Essential navigation |
| Medium | Year/Rating/Genre filters, Combined filters | Advanced features |
| Low | UI polish, edge case combinations | Nice-to-have |

**Test Design Techniques:**

| Technique | Application | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Boundary Value Analysis (BVA) | Pagination limits, rating ranges | Last page, page 1, invalid page numbers |
| Equivalence Partitioning (EP) | Valid/invalid inputs, categories | Valid years (1900-2025), invalid (-1, 9999) |
| Decision Tables | Combined filter scenarios | Year + Rating + Genre interactions |
| Exploratory Testing | New defect discovery | Found DEF-003 through DEF-006 |
| Negative Testing | Error handling, edge cases | Direct URL access (DEF-001) |

**Trade-offs:** Focus on demonstrating thinking over exhaustive coverage - cannot test all combinations in 2-day timeframe

---

## 4. Code Architecture & Patterns

### Decision: Simple Page Object Model (POM)

**Rationale:** "Frameworks matter less than you think" - maintainability without over-engineering

**Implementation:** (See Section 0 for complete directory structure)

| Component | Files | Responsibility |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| Page Objects | `src/movie_db_qa/pages/base_page.py` | Common page interactions |
| | `src/movie_db_qa/pages/discover_page.py` | TMDB discovery page actions |
| Utilities | `src/movie_db_qa/utils/logger.py` | Logging configuration |
| | `src/movie_db_qa/utils/config.py` | Settings management |
| Test Cases | `tests/test_filtering.py` | Category/search filter tests |
| | `tests/test_pagination.py` | Navigation and boundary tests |
| | `tests/test_negative.py` | Error handling and edge cases |
| Fixtures | `tests/conftest.py` | Pytest setup/teardown |

**Pattern Benefits:**

| Benefit | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Maintainability | Page changes isolated to page objects, not scattered in tests |
| Readability | Tests read like business scenarios: `page.select_popular_filter()` |
| Reusability | Common actions in `base_page.py`, shared across tests |
| Industry Standard | Demonstrates understanding of professional patterns |

**Alternatives Rejected:**

| Pattern | Why Rejected |
|---------|--------------|
| Raw Selenium (no pattern) | Code duplication, harder to maintain |
| Screenplay pattern | Over-engineering for small project |
| Keyword-driven | Unnecessary abstraction layer |

**Trade-off:** Simple POM (1-2 page objects) vs. comprehensive hierarchy - acceptable for demo scope

---

## 5. Test Scope & Coverage

### Decision: Core Features + Known Issues + Exploratory

**Rationale:** Small scope, deep quality - test what matters most in 24-30 hour constraint

**Test Scope:**

| Status | Feature | Rationale | Implementation |
|--------|---------|-----------|----------------|
| ✅ In Scope | Category filters (Popular, Trending, etc.) | Primary user workflows | `docs/test-cases.md` |
| ✅ In Scope | Search (title) | Core discovery method | `docs/test-cases.md` |
| ✅ In Scope | Pagination (navigation, boundaries) | Essential navigation + known issues | `docs/test-cases.md` |
| ✅ In Scope | Type filter (Movies/TV Shows) | Common use case | `docs/test-cases.md` |
| ✅ In Scope | Advanced filters (Year, Rating, Genre) | Advanced discovery | `docs/test-cases.md` |
| ✅ In Scope | Negative cases (Direct URL, invalid inputs) | Known issues validation | `docs/test-cases.md` |
| ✅ In Scope | API validation (network calls) | Backend contract testing | Phase 3 |
| ❌ Out of Scope | Movie detail pages | Not discovery feature | N/A |
| ❌ Out of Scope | Performance testing | Not required | N/A |
| ❌ Out of Scope | Security/Accessibility | Not in requirements | N/A |
| ❌ Out of Scope | Mobile responsiveness | Desktop focus | N/A |
| ❌ Out of Scope | Cross-browser (Safari/Edge) | Chrome/Firefox only | Phase 3 |

---

## 6. Quality & Standards

### Decision: PEP8 + Type Hints + 100% Test Coverage (for framework code)

**Rationale:** "Quality, maintainability, understandability" is 25% of score - professional standards required

**Quality Tools:**

| Tool | Version | Purpose | Configuration | Runs In |
|------|---------|---------|---------------|---------|
| ruff | ≥0.1.0 | All-in-one linter (replaces flake8, isort, pyupgrade) | `pyproject.toml` | `Makefile` + `.pre-commit-config.yaml` + CI |
| black | ≥23.0 | Code formatter (120 char lines) | `pyproject.toml` | `Makefile` + `.pre-commit-config.yaml` + CI |
| mypy | ≥1.0 | Static type checker (strict mode) | `pyproject.toml` | `Makefile` + `.pre-commit-config.yaml` + CI |
| pytest-cov | ≥4.0 | Coverage reporting (100% target, branch coverage) | `pyproject.toml` | `Makefile` + CI |
| pre-commit | ≥3.0 | Git hooks (quality gates before commit) | `.pre-commit-config.yaml` | Local commits |

**Enforcement Points:**

| Gate | Command | When | What Gets Checked |
|------|---------|------|-------------------|
| Local Pre-Commit | `pre-commit run --all-files` | Before git commit | ruff + mypy + pytest |
| Makefile Quality | `make quality` | Before test runs | ruff + mypy + black |
| CI Pipeline | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Every push/PR | quality → tests → coverage |

**Trade-offs:** Initial setup time vs. catching bugs early and demonstrating professional standards

---

## 7. Configuration Management

### Decision: Centralized Config with Dataclass (NOT YAML)

**Philosophy:** **"Data-driven code is as important as unit tests"** - Separate data from logic

**Rationale:**
- **Change behavior without code changes** (deploy != code change)
- **Single source of truth** for test settings
- **Environment-agnostic tests** (same code, different config)
- **Testable configuration** (validate config independently)

**Implementation:** `src/movie_db_qa/utils/config.py`

```python
@dataclass
class TestConfig:
    base_url: str = "https://tmdb-discover.surge.sh"
    browser: Literal["chromium", "firefox", "webkit"] = "chromium"
    headless: bool = True
    timeout: int = 30000  # milliseconds
    slow_mo: int = 0      # debugging aid
```

**Why Dataclass (NOT YAML)?**

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| **Python Dataclass** ✅ | Type-safe, IDE autocomplete, no parsing | Python-only | **CHOSEN** |
| YAML file | Human-readable, external | Type-unsafe, parsing overhead, extra dependency | Rejected |
| Environment variables | 12-factor app pattern | No validation, string-only | Future enhancement |
| JSON file | Language-agnostic | No comments, type-unsafe | Rejected |

**Design Principles:**

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Type Safety** | Python 3.13 type hints + mypy validation |
| **Simple Defaults** | Sane defaults for 90% use case |
| **No Magic** | Explicit values, no hidden config files |
| **Testable** | Easy to mock/override in tests |
| **IDE Support** | Autocomplete, go-to-definition, refactoring |

**Usage Pattern:**

```python
# Import once
from movie_db_qa.utils.config import config

# Use everywhere
page.goto(config.base_url)           # No hardcoded URLs
page.set_default_timeout(config.timeout)  # No magic numbers
browser.launch(headless=config.headless)  # Toggle via code
```

**Benefits:**

| Without Config | With Config | Benefit |
|----------------|-------------|---------|
| `"https://tmdb..."` in 10+ files | `config.base_url` | Change URL in 1 place |
| `30000` scattered everywhere | `config.timeout` | Centralized timeout |
| Edit code to debug | `config.headless = False` | Easy debugging |
| Hardcoded browser | `config.browser = "firefox"` | Swap browsers |

**Future: Environment Variable Support**

```python
# Phase 4+ enhancement
@classmethod
def from_env(cls) -> "TestConfig":
    return cls(
        base_url=os.getenv("BASE_URL", cls.base_url),
        browser=os.getenv("BROWSER", cls.browser),
        headless=os.getenv("HEADLESS", "true").lower() == "true",
    )
```

**Why NOT YAML for This Project:**

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Overkill** | 5 config values don't need external file |
| **Type Safety** | YAML loses Python types, requires validation |
| **Simplicity** | Dataclass = 15 lines, YAML = parsing + validation + schema |
| **Scope** | 2-day assignment, not multi-environment enterprise app |

**When to Use YAML:** Multi-environment (dev/staging/prod), 50+ config values, non-Python users

**Alternatives Rejected:**

| Option | Why Rejected |
|--------|--------------|
| Hardcoded values | Not maintainable, can't change environments |
| YAML/JSON files | Over-engineering for 5 config values |
| Global variables | Not testable, no type safety |
| Environment variables only | No defaults, string-only values |

**Why Data-Driven Code Matters (Like Unit Tests):**

| Principle | Code-Driven (Bad) | Data-Driven (Good) |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Change browser** | Edit code, recompile, redeploy | Change config, restart |
| **Debug test** | Comment/uncomment code | `headless=False` in config |
| **Environment switch** | if/else in code | Load different config |
| **A/B testing** | Duplicate code | Same code, different config |
| **Rollback** | Git revert, redeploy | Revert config, restart |

**Example: The Power of Config**

```python
# BAD: Hardcoded (logic + data mixed)
def test_popular_filter(page):
    page.goto("https://tmdb-discover.surge.sh")  # ← Hardcoded!
    page.set_default_timeout(30000)               # ← Magic number!

    if os.getenv("DEBUG"):  # ← Logic based on env
        page.screenshot("debug.png")
```

```python
# GOOD: Data-driven (logic separate from data)
def test_popular_filter(page):
    page.goto(config.base_url)        # ← Configurable
    page.set_default_timeout(config.timeout)  # ← Centralized

    if config.debug_mode:  # ← Config-driven behavior
        page.screenshot("debug.png")
```

**Benefit:**
- ✅ Switch staging → production: Change 1 line in config
- ✅ Debug mode: Toggle 1 boolean
- ✅ Test config itself: Unit test config validation
- ✅ No code changes = No new bugs introduced

**Config = Unit Test Analogy:**

| Without Unit Tests | Without Config |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Can't refactor safely | Can't change environments safely |
| Hidden bugs | Hardcoded values scattered |
| Fear of change | Fear of deployment |
| Manual testing | Manual code edits |

| With Unit Tests | With Config |
|-----------------|-------------|
| ✅ Refactor confidently | ✅ Deploy confidently |
| ✅ Automated validation | ✅ Centralized control |
| ✅ Fast feedback | ✅ Fast environment switch |
| ✅ Living documentation | ✅ Behavior documentation |

**Trade-off:** Simple dataclass now, can migrate to env vars later without refactoring tests (change happens only in `config.py`)

**Configuration as Code Quality Practice:** Just like unit tests ensure code correctness, config ensures **operational flexibility**

**Testing Configuration (Like Unit Tests):**

```python
# tests/test_config.py - Yes, test your config!
def test_config_has_valid_url():
    """Ensure base URL is reachable."""
    assert config.base_url.startswith("https://")
    assert "tmdb" in config.base_url

def test_config_timeout_reasonable():
    """Timeout should be between 5-60 seconds."""
    assert 5000 <= config.timeout <= 60000

def test_config_browser_supported():
    """Browser must be supported by Playwright."""
    assert config.browser in ["chromium", "firefox", "webkit"]

def test_staging_config_differs_from_prod():
    """Staging config should point to staging URL."""
    staging = TestConfig.from_env("staging")
    prod = TestConfig.from_env("production")
    assert staging.base_url != prod.base_url
```

**Why This Matters:**
- ✅ Catch config errors **before** running tests
- ✅ Validate environment-specific configs
- ✅ Prevent production URL in staging tests (and vice versa)
- ✅ Config becomes **self-documenting** (tests show valid ranges)

**Real-World Scenario:**
```
# Without config tests
❌ Tests run for 30 minutes
❌ All tests fail
❌ Root cause: Typo in base URL ("htps://" instead of "https://")
❌ Cost: 30 minutes wasted

# With config tests
✅ Config test fails in 0.1 seconds
✅ "Invalid URL: htps://tmdb..."
✅ Fix typo immediately
✅ Cost: 10 seconds
```

**Configuration = First-Class Citizen** (like tests, not second-class hardcoded values)

---

## 8. Logging Strategy

### Decision: Abstracted Logger with `setup_logger()` Utility

**Rationale:** **Assignment requirement** + flexibility to swap logging backends without refactoring tests

**Implementation:** `src/movie_db_qa/utils/logger.py`

```python
def setup_logger(
    name: str,
    level: int = logging.WARNING,
    log_file: str | None = None,
) -> logging.Logger:
    """Configure logger with console + optional file output."""
    logger = logging.getLogger(name)
    # Console handler for pytest output
    # File handler for CI artifacts
    # Formatted with timestamp
    return logger
```

**Abstraction Strategy:**

| Component | Current Implementation | Future Backend Options |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Console** | `StreamHandler(sys.stdout)` | ✅ Keep for local dev |
| **File** | `FileHandler(log_path)` (optional) | ✅ CI artifacts |
| **Structured** | Plain text | → JSON formatter (production) |
| **Cloud** | None | → CloudWatch, Datadog, Elasticsearch |
| **Alerts** | None | → Slack on ERROR level |

**Key Design Decision: Centralized Setup**

```python
# Every test/page object uses same pattern
from movie_db_qa.utils.logger import setup_logger
logger = setup_logger(__name__)

# Works everywhere
logger.info("Test started")
logger.debug("Clicking element")
logger.error("Test failed: %s", error)
```

**Why `setup_logger()` Abstraction?**

| Benefit | Without Abstraction | With Abstraction |
|---------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Change backend** | Edit 20+ files | Edit 1 file (`logger.py`) |
| **Add Elasticsearch** | Refactor all tests | Add handler in `setup_logger()` |
| **Toggle file logging** | Edit each test | Change `log_file` parameter |
| **Consistency** | Each dev does differently | Enforced pattern |

**Logging Levels:**

| Level | When | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| DEBUG | Development, troubleshooting | `logger.debug("Page URL: %s", page.url)` |
| INFO | Test execution flow | `logger.info("Test started: %s", test_name)` |
| WARNING | Default production | `logger.warning("Slow page load: %s", duration)` |
| ERROR | Test failures, exceptions | `logger.error("Failed: %s", error)` |

**What Gets Logged:**

| Where | What | Why |
|-------|------|-----|
| `conftest.py` | Browser launch/close | Track fixture lifecycle |
| `base_page.py` | Page navigation, waits | Debug page interactions |
| `discover_page.py` | Filter clicks, pagination | Track user actions |
| Tests | Test start/end, assertions | Test execution flow |

**Example Output:**

```
2025-10-04 14:23:01 - conftest - INFO - Launching chromium (headless=True)
2025-10-04 14:23:02 - test_filtering - INFO - Test started: Popular filter
2025-10-04 14:23:03 - discover_page - DEBUG - Navigating to https://tmdb-discover.surge.sh
2025-10-04 14:23:04 - discover_page - DEBUG - Clicking Popular filter
2025-10-04 14:23:05 - discover_page - DEBUG - Results count: 20
2025-10-04 14:23:05 - test_filtering - INFO - Test passed
```

**Future Enhancement: Swap Backend (ZERO Test Changes)**

```python
# utils/logger.py - ONLY file that changes
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

class ElasticsearchHandler(logging.Handler):
    def emit(self, record):
        self.es.index(index="qa-logs", body={
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow(),
            "level": record.levelname,
            "message": record.getMessage(),
        })

def setup_logger(name, level=logging.INFO, use_elasticsearch=True):
    logger = logging.getLogger(name)
    logger.addHandler(ElasticsearchHandler())  # ← NEW
    return logger
```

**All tests:** ZERO changes, automatically log to Elasticsearch ✅

**Why Controlled Logging Format Matters:**

| Use Case | Benefit | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **AI Log Analysis** | LLMs need structured, consistent logs | Claude/GPT can parse patterns |
| **Debugging** | Quickly find failure root cause | Search for ERROR level |
| **Metrics** | Track test performance over time | Parse duration from logs |
| **Alerting** | Trigger on specific patterns | Slack on 3+ failures |
| **Compliance** | Audit trail for test execution | Who ran what, when |

**Example: AI-Friendly Structured Logging**

```python
# Current: Plain text (still parseable)
2025-10-04 14:23:05 - test_filtering - ERROR - Test failed: AssertionError

# Future: JSON structured (optimal for AI)
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-04T14:23:05Z",
  "level": "ERROR",
  "test_name": "test_filtering",
  "message": "Test failed",
  "error_type": "AssertionError",
  "page_url": "https://tmdb-discover.surge.sh/popular",
  "screenshot": "screenshots/test_filtering_fail.png"
}
```

**Benefit:** AI can analyze patterns across thousands of test runs:
- "Show me all tests that failed on pagination"
- "What's the average duration for filter tests?"
- "Which tests fail most often on Fridays?" (seriously!)

**Implementation Path:**

```python
# Phase 3: Plain text (human-readable)
logger.info("Test started: %s", test_name)

# Phase 4+: JSON structured (AI-parseable)
logger.info("Test started", extra={
    "test_name": test_name,
    "browser": "chromium",
    "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
})
```

**Alternatives Considered:**

| Option | Why Rejected |
|--------|--------------|
| Print statements | Not professional, no levels, no formatting, **AI can't parse** |
| `logging.getLogger()` everywhere | No consistency, hard to change backends |
| Third-party (loguru, structlog) | Unnecessary dependency, built-in sufficient |
| No logging | Assignment explicitly requires it |

**Trade-off:** 55 lines of `logger.py` now = ability to swap backends later without touching 20+ test files + **AI-ready log analysis in future**

---

## 9. Reporting Strategy

### Decision: Pytest-HTML + Console + Coverage Reports

**Rationale:** Assignment requires "Console + HTML reports" - use built-in pytest ecosystem

**Report Outputs:**

| Report Type | Library | Output Location | Contents | Command |
|-------------|---------|-----------------|----------|---------|
| HTML Test Report | pytest-html | `reports/test_report.html` | Results, timing, failures, screenshots | `pytest --html=reports/test_report.html` |
| Console Report | pytest (built-in) | stdout | Live execution, summary, tracebacks | `pytest -v` |
| Coverage Report | pytest-cov | `htmlcov/index.html` | Line/branch coverage, missing lines | `pytest --cov --cov-report=html` |

**Features:**

| Report | Key Features |
|--------|--------------|
| HTML | Professional format, shareable, failure details with screenshots, environment info |
| Console | Real-time feedback, `-ra` summary, `--tb=short` compact tracebacks, pass/fail counts |
| Coverage | Per-file breakdown, line-by-line visualization, branch coverage, missing lines highlighted |

**Alternatives Rejected:**

| Option | Why Rejected |
|--------|--------------|
| Custom HTML | Over-engineering, wastes time |
| Allure framework | Unnecessary complexity for 2-day assignment |
| Only console | Doesn't meet HTML requirement |

---

## 10. CI/CD Strategy

### Decision: GitHub Actions - FULLY IMPLEMENTED
**What We're Doing:**
- ✅ **GitHub Actions CI pipeline RUNNING** in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- ✅ **Automated quality gates** on every push and PR
- ✅ **Python 3.13** environment setup
- ✅ **Multi-stage pipeline** with quality + testing
- ✅ **Branch protection** ready (develop/main)

**Rationale:**
- **Assignment requirement:** "How you'd approach CI integration (document, don't implement)"
- **Our approach:** Document AND implement (bonus value)
- **GitHub integration:** Native to repository platform, zero configuration needed
- **Free tier:** No cost for public repositories
- **Modern standard:** Industry-standard CI/CD tool
- **Fast feedback:** Results in 2-3 minutes

**Implementation Details:**

**Workflow File:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Pipeline Stages:**
1. **Checkout** (`actions/checkout@v4`)
   - Clone repository with full history
   - Fetch all branches for comparison

2. **Setup Python** (`actions/setup-python@v5`)
   - Install Python 3.13
   - Cache pip dependencies
   - Verify installation

3. **Install Dependencies**
   - `pip install -e .[dev]`
   - Installs: pytest, pytest-cov, ruff, mypy, black, pre-commit

4. **Quality Checks**
   - `ruff check .` - Linting (fast fail if code quality issues)
   - `mypy src/` - Type checking (catch type errors early)
   - `black --check .` - Format verification

5. **Run Tests**
   - `pytest --cov --cov-report=html --cov-report=term`
   - Generate coverage reports
   - Fail if coverage drops below threshold

6. **Upload Artifacts** (future)
   - HTML test reports
   - Coverage reports
   - Screenshots from failures

**Triggers:**
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop, feature/*]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger
```

**Environment:**
- **OS:** Ubuntu 24.04 (latest)
- **Python:** 3.13
- **Timeout:** 10 minutes max
- **Concurrency:** Cancel outdated runs

**Future Enhancements (Documented for README):**
- **Parallel execution:** Matrix strategy for Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13
- **Browser matrix:** Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- **Scheduled runs:** Nightly regression tests
- **Notifications:** Slack/email on failures
- **Deployment:** Auto-deploy to test environment on develop merge
- **Release automation:** Tag and publish on main merge

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Jenkins:** More powerful but requires self-hosting, complex setup
- **CircleCI:** Good but less GitHub integration, paid for private repos
- **GitLab CI:** Excellent but would require moving to GitLab
- **Travis CI:** Legacy option, less popular now
- **No implementation:** Assignment says "document only" - we exceeded expectations

**Trade-offs:**
- GitHub Actions tied to GitHub (not portable)
- Free tier has usage limits (2000 min/month - plenty for this project)
- Less flexible than Jenkins for complex pipelines
- **Worth it:** Zero setup cost, native integration, fast feedback

## 11. Defect Reporting Approach

### Decision: Structured Markdown Reports with Evidence
**Rationale:**
- **Assignment emphasis:** Finding defects is core to QA mindset evaluation
- **Professional format:** Clear, reproducible, actionable
- **Evidence-based:** Screenshots and detailed steps
- **Developer-friendly:** Markdown format, easy to read/track

**Defect Report Template:**
```
ID: DEF-001
Title: [Clear, specific title]
Severity: Critical/High/Medium/Low
Priority: P0/P1/P2/P3

Steps to Reproduce:
1. [Clear, numbered steps]
2. [Anyone can follow]
3. [No assumptions]

Expected Result: [What should happen]
Actual Result: [What actually happens]

Evidence: [Screenshot/video]
Environment: Browser, OS, URL
Found By: [Exploratory/BVA/EP/etc.]
```

**Defect Hunting Strategy:**
1. Reproduce 2 known issues (pagination, direct URL)
2. Exploratory testing on all features (find 3+ new bugs)
3. Boundary testing (edge cases)
4. Combined filters (interaction bugs)
5. API validation (backend errors)

**Target:** 5+ total defects (2 known + 3+ new), with at least 1-2 medium/high severity

## 12. Documentation Strategy

### Decision: Comprehensive, WHY-Focused Documentation
**Rationale:**
- **Assignment emphasis:** "Please document as much as you can"
- **Highest scorer:** Documentation is 25-30% of total evaluation
- **Critical question:** "WHY did you choose these test cases?" must be answered
- **Communication skill:** Show ability to explain technical decisions

**Documentation Structure:**
```
README.md                    # Answers ALL 8 required questions
docs/
  test-strategy.md          # Testing approach and WHY
  test-cases.md             # Detailed test descriptions with WHY
  defects.md                # Defect reports with evidence
  design-decisions.md       # This document - shows thinking
  assignment-overview.md    # Reference
  priorities.md             # Reference
```

**8 Required README Sections:**
1. ✅ Testing Strategy (approach + rationale)
2. ✅ Test Cases Overview (WHAT + **WHY**)
3. ✅ Framework Information (tools + versions)
4. ✅ How to Run Tests (complete instructions)
5. ✅ Test Design Techniques (applied where)
6. ✅ Coding Patterns (patterns + rationale)
7. ✅ Defects Found (summary + link)
8. ✅ CI Integration Approach (strategy + tools)

**Documentation Principles:**
- **Clarity over cleverness:** Anyone can understand
- **WHY over WHAT:** Explain reasoning, not just facts
- **Examples included:** Show, don't just tell
- **No assumptions:** Complete instructions for newcomers

## 13. Time Allocation & Prioritization

### Decision: Focus 80% on High-Impact Deliverables

**Rationale:** "Frameworks matter less than you think" - focus where points are awarded

**Time Allocation (24-30 hours):**

| Phase | Hours | Score Impact | Status |
|-------|-------|--------------|--------|
| Setup (Phase 1) | 2-3 hrs | Foundation | ✅ COMPLETED v0.2.0 |
| Test Design + Docs | 6-8 hrs | 30% | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| Implementation | 6-8 hrs | 25% | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| Defect Reports | 3-4 hrs | 15% | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| Documentation (README) | 4-5 hrs | 25% | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| CI Strategy | 2-3 hrs | 5% | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| Polish & Delivery | 2-3 hrs | Presentation | 🟡 MEDIUM |

**Effort Allocation:**

| Impact | Activities | Effort |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| High (80%) | WHY explanations, clean code, README (8 sections), 5+ defects, thinking documentation | 20-24 hrs |
| Low (20%) | Framework choice, architecture complexity, advanced patterns, custom tooling | 4-6 hrs |

## 14. Success Metrics & Quality Gates

### Decision: Rubric-Based Self-Evaluation at Each Phase

**Rationale:** Catch issues early, ensure meeting all requirements before submission

**Quality Gates:**

| Phase | Gate | Target Score | Evaluation Artifact |
|-------|------|--------------|---------------------|
| Phase 2 (Test Design) | Test cases documented with WHY | ≥70/100 | `rubric/reports/phase2-eval.md` |
| Phase 3 (Implementation) | Tests passing, code clean | ≥70/100 | `rubric/reports/phase3-eval.md` |
| Phase 5 (Documentation) | README complete (8 sections) | ≥85/100 | `rubric/reports/phase5-eval.md` |
| Phase 7 (Final) | Complete deliverable | ≥85/100 | `rubric/reports/final-eval.md` |

**Thresholds:**
- **70/100** - Passing (professional quality)
- **85/100** - Excellence (outstanding deliverable)

**Framework:** `rubric/eval-rubric.md` (scoring), `rubric/eval-prompt.md` (AI evaluation)
