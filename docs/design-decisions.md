## 1. Framework & Technology Selection

### Decision: Python 3.13 + Pytest

**Rationale:** Most expeditious choice for rapid test development with professional quality gates

| Component | Library | Version | Purpose | Implementation |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|----------------|
| Test Framework | pytest | ≥7.0 | Test runner and framework | `pyproject.toml` |
| Coverage | pytest-cov | ≥4.0 | Branch coverage reporting | `pyproject.toml` + `Makefile` |
| HTML Reports | pytest-html | ≥1.0 | Test result reports | `pyproject.toml` |
| Browser Automation | **playwright** | ≥1.40 | **Web UI testing** | **`pyproject.toml`** |
| Linter | ruff | ≥0.1.0 | Fast all-in-one linter | `.pre-commit-config.yaml` |
| Type Checker | mypy | ≥1.0 | Static type checking | `.pre-commit-config.yaml` |
| Formatter | black | ≥23.0 | Code formatting | `.pre-commit-config.yaml` |
| Git Hooks | pre-commit | ≥3.0 | Quality gates | `.pre-commit-config.yaml` |

**Browser Automation: Playwright vs Selenium Decision**

| Factor | Playwright | Selenium | Winner |
|--------|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Speed** | Faster (auto-waits, parallel) | Slower (explicit waits) | ✅ Playwright |
| **Modern SPA support** | Excellent (built for React/Vue) | Good (requires more config) | ✅ Playwright |
| **Network mocking/interception** | Built-in | Requires proxy/extensions | ✅ Playwright |
| **API testing** | Integrated | Separate tools needed | ✅ Playwright |
| **Setup** | `pip install playwright` + `playwright install` | `pip install selenium` + driver management | ✅ Playwright |
| **Learning curve** | Modern, intuitive API | Legacy patterns | ✅ Playwright |
| **Maintenance** | Auto-updates browsers | Driver version hell | ✅ Playwright |
| **Python typing** | Excellent | Limited | ✅ Playwright |
| **TMDB site fit** | Perfect (SPA, dynamic content) | Works but requires more code | ✅ Playwright |

**Decision: Playwright ✅**

**Rationale:**
- **Starting fresh** - No legacy Selenium tests to maintain
- **Modern SPA** - TMDB is React/Vue with dynamic content, Playwright handles better
- **Speed** - Faster execution = faster feedback loop (critical for 2-day assignment)
- **Network validation** - Built-in API interception for backend testing (assignment requirement)
- **Less maintenance** - Auto-wait, auto-browser updates, better error messages
- **Team expertise** - Python team, Playwright has superior Python support

**Alternatives Rejected:**

| Option | Why Rejected |
|--------|--------------|
| Selenium | Older API, driver management overhead, slower for SPAs |
| Cypress | JavaScript-only, not Python ecosystem |
| Puppeteer | JavaScript-only, Chrome-focused |
| Both Selenium + Playwright | Unnecessary complexity, doubles maintenance |

**Implementation:**
```python
# pyproject.toml
dev = [
    "playwright>=1.40",
    "pytest-playwright>=0.4",
]

# Install browsers
playwright install chromium
```

**Outcome:** ✅ Delivered v0.2.0 framework in Phase 1 with full CI/CD pipeline

---

## 2. Version Control Strategy

### Decision: Git-flow Branching Model
**Rationale:**
- **Professional workflow:** Separate feature branches → develop → main release flow
- **Quality gates:** Each merge requires passing tests and code review
- **Release management:** Clean release history with semantic versioning
- **Assignment alignment:** Demonstrates understanding of professional development practices

**Branch Structure:**
```
main              # Production releases (v0.2.0, v1.0.0, etc.)
develop           # Integration branch
feature/*         # Feature development branches
  feature/test-design
  feature/test-implementation
  feature/defect-reporting
  feature/documentation
  feature/ci-enhancements
  feature/polish
```

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Trunk-based development:** Simpler, but less clear separation of work phases
- **GitHub flow:** Simpler than git-flow, but wanted to show full release management

**Trade-offs Accepted:**
- More complex than simple main-branch workflow
- Requires discipline in merging and branch management
- Worth it for demonstrating professional practices

---

## 3. Test Design Strategy

### Decision: Risk-Based + Design Techniques Approach

**Rationale:** "Which cases did you generate and WHY?" - Assignment requires clear prioritization and formal test design

**Priority Framework:**

| Priority | Features | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Critical | Core filters (Popular, Trending, Newest, Top Rated) | Primary user workflows |
| High | Pagination, Search, Type filters | Essential navigation |
| Medium | Year/Rating/Genre filters, Combined filters | Advanced features |
| Low | UI polish, edge case combinations | Nice-to-have |

**Test Design Techniques:**

| Technique | Application | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Boundary Value Analysis (BVA) | Pagination limits, rating ranges | Last page, page 1, invalid page numbers |
| Equivalence Partitioning (EP) | Valid/invalid inputs, categories | Valid years (1900-2025), invalid (-1, 9999) |
| Decision Tables | Combined filter scenarios | Year + Rating + Genre interactions |
| Exploratory Testing | New defect discovery | Found DEF-003 through DEF-006 |
| Negative Testing | Error handling, edge cases | Direct URL access (DEF-001) |

**Trade-offs:** Focus on demonstrating thinking over exhaustive coverage - cannot test all combinations in 2-day timeframe

---

## 4. Code Architecture & Patterns

### Decision: Simple Page Object Model (POM)

**Rationale:** "Frameworks matter less than you think" - maintainability without over-engineering

**Implementation:** (See Section 0 for complete directory structure)

| Component | Files | Responsibility |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| Page Objects | `src/movie_db_qa/pages/base_page.py` | Common page interactions |
| | `src/movie_db_qa/pages/discover_page.py` | TMDB discovery page actions |
| Utilities | `src/movie_db_qa/utils/logger.py` | Logging configuration |
| | `src/movie_db_qa/utils/config.py` | Settings management |
| Test Cases | `tests/test_filtering.py` | Category/search filter tests |
| | `tests/test_pagination.py` | Navigation and boundary tests |
| | `tests/test_negative.py` | Error handling and edge cases |
| Fixtures | `tests/conftest.py` | Pytest setup/teardown |

**Pattern Benefits:**

| Benefit | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Maintainability | Page changes isolated to page objects, not scattered in tests |
| Readability | Tests read like business scenarios: `page.select_popular_filter()` |
| Reusability | Common actions in `base_page.py`, shared across tests |
| Industry Standard | Demonstrates understanding of professional patterns |

**Alternatives Rejected:**

| Pattern | Why Rejected |
|---------|--------------|
| Raw Selenium (no pattern) | Code duplication, harder to maintain |
| Screenplay pattern | Over-engineering for small project |
| Keyword-driven | Unnecessary abstraction layer |

**Trade-off:** Simple POM (1-2 page objects) vs. comprehensive hierarchy - acceptable for demo scope

---

## 5. Test Scope & Coverage

### Decision: Core Features + Known Issues + Exploratory

**Rationale:** Small scope, deep quality - test what matters most in 24-30 hour constraint

**Test Scope:**

| Status | Feature | Rationale | Implementation |
|--------|---------|-----------|----------------|
| ✅ In Scope | Category filters (Popular, Trending, etc.) | Primary user workflows | `docs/test-cases.md` |
| ✅ In Scope | Search (title) | Core discovery method | `docs/test-cases.md` |
| ✅ In Scope | Pagination (navigation, boundaries) | Essential navigation + known issues | `docs/test-cases.md` |
| ✅ In Scope | Type filter (Movies/TV Shows) | Common use case | `docs/test-cases.md` |
| ✅ In Scope | Advanced filters (Year, Rating, Genre) | Advanced discovery | `docs/test-cases.md` |
| ✅ In Scope | Negative cases (Direct URL, invalid inputs) | Known issues validation | `docs/test-cases.md` |
| ✅ In Scope | API validation (network calls) | Backend contract testing | Phase 3 |
| ❌ Out of Scope | Movie detail pages | Not discovery feature | N/A |
| ❌ Out of Scope | Performance testing | Not required | N/A |
| ❌ Out of Scope | Security/Accessibility | Not in requirements | N/A |
| ❌ Out of Scope | Mobile responsiveness | Desktop focus | N/A |
| ❌ Out of Scope | Cross-browser (Safari/Edge) | Chrome/Firefox only | Phase 3 |

---

## 6. Quality & Standards

### Decision: PEP8 + Type Hints + 100% Test Coverage (for framework code)

**Rationale:** "Quality, maintainability, understandability" is 25% of score - professional standards required

**Quality Tools:**

| Tool | Version | Purpose | Configuration | Runs In |
|------|---------|---------|---------------|---------|
| ruff | ≥0.1.0 | All-in-one linter (replaces flake8, isort, pyupgrade) | `pyproject.toml` | `Makefile` + `.pre-commit-config.yaml` + CI |
| black | ≥23.0 | Code formatter (120 char lines) | `pyproject.toml` | `Makefile` + `.pre-commit-config.yaml` + CI |
| mypy | ≥1.0 | Static type checker (strict mode) | `pyproject.toml` | `Makefile` + `.pre-commit-config.yaml` + CI |
| pytest-cov | ≥4.0 | Coverage reporting (100% target, branch coverage) | `pyproject.toml` | `Makefile` + CI |
| pre-commit | ≥3.0 | Git hooks (quality gates before commit) | `.pre-commit-config.yaml` | Local commits |

**Enforcement Points:**

| Gate | Command | When | What Gets Checked |
|------|---------|------|-------------------|
| Local Pre-Commit | `pre-commit run --all-files` | Before git commit | ruff + mypy + pytest |
| Makefile Quality | `make quality` | Before test runs | ruff + mypy + black |
| CI Pipeline | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Every push/PR | quality → tests → coverage |

**Trade-offs:** Initial setup time vs. catching bugs early and demonstrating professional standards

---

## 7. Configuration Management

### Decision: Centralized Config with Dataclass (NOT YAML)

**Philosophy:** **"Data-driven code is as important as unit tests"** - Separate data from logic

**Rationale:** Change behavior without code changes, single source of truth, environment-agnostic tests

**Implementation:** `src/movie_db_qa/utils/config.py`

```python
@dataclass
class TestConfig:
    base_url: str = "https://tmdb-discover.surge.sh"
    browser: Literal["chromium", "firefox", "webkit"] = "chromium"
    headless: bool = True
    timeout: int = 30000  # milliseconds
```

**Why Dataclass over YAML?**

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| **Python Dataclass** | Type-safe, IDE autocomplete, no parsing | Python-only | **✅ CHOSEN** |
| YAML file | Human-readable, external | Type-unsafe, parsing, extra dependency | Rejected |
| Environment variables | 12-factor pattern | No validation, string-only | Future |

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ Type safety (Python 3.13 + mypy)
- ✅ No magic numbers (`config.timeout` instead of `30000` everywhere)
- ✅ Easy debugging (`config.headless = False`)
- ✅ Testable configuration (validate config independently)
- ✅ IDE support (autocomplete, refactoring)

**Usage:**
```python
from movie_db_qa.utils.config import config
page.goto(config.base_url)  # No hardcoded URLs
```

**Why NOT YAML for 2-day assignment:**
- Only 5 config values (overkill for external file)
- Type safety lost with YAML parsing
- Dataclass = 15 lines, YAML = parsing + validation + schema

**When to Use YAML:** Multi-environment enterprise apps (dev/staging/prod), 50+ config values

**Trade-off:** 55 lines of `config.py` now = ability to swap environments later without touching 20+ test files

---

## 8. Logging Strategy

### Decision: Abstracted Logger with `setup_logger()` Utility

**Rationale:** **Assignment requirement** + flexibility to swap logging backends without refactoring tests

**Implementation:** `src/movie_db_qa/utils/logger.py`

```python
def setup_logger(
    name: str,
    level: int = logging.WARNING,
    log_file: str | None = None,
) -> logging.Logger:
    """Configure logger with console + optional file output."""
    logger = logging.getLogger(name)
    # Console handler for pytest output
    # File handler for CI artifacts
    # Formatted with timestamp
    return logger
```

**Abstraction Strategy:**

| Component | Current Implementation | Future Backend Options |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Console** | `StreamHandler(sys.stdout)` | ✅ Keep for local dev |
| **File** | `FileHandler(log_path)` (optional) | ✅ CI artifacts |
| **Structured** | Plain text | → JSON formatter (production) |
| **Cloud** | None | → CloudWatch, Datadog, Elasticsearch |
| **Alerts** | None | → Slack on ERROR level |

**Key Design Decision: Centralized Setup**

```python
# Every test/page object uses same pattern
from movie_db_qa.utils.logger import setup_logger
logger = setup_logger(__name__)

# Works everywhere
logger.info("Test started")
logger.debug("Clicking element")
logger.error("Test failed: %s", error)
```

**Why `setup_logger()` Abstraction?**

| Benefit | Without Abstraction | With Abstraction |
|---------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Change backend** | Edit 20+ files | Edit 1 file (`logger.py`) |
| **Add Elasticsearch** | Refactor all tests | Add handler in `setup_logger()` |
| **Toggle file logging** | Edit each test | Change `log_file` parameter |
| **Consistency** | Each dev does differently | Enforced pattern |

**Logging Levels:**

| Level | When | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| DEBUG | Development, troubleshooting | `logger.debug("Page URL: %s", page.url)` |
| INFO | Test execution flow | `logger.info("Test started: %s", test_name)` |
| WARNING | Default production | `logger.warning("Slow page load: %s", duration)` |
| ERROR | Test failures, exceptions | `logger.error("Failed: %s", error)` |

**What Gets Logged:**

| Where | What | Why |
|-------|------|-----|
| `conftest.py` | Browser launch/close | Track fixture lifecycle |
| `base_page.py` | Page navigation, waits | Debug page interactions |
| `discover_page.py` | Filter clicks, pagination | Track user actions |
| Tests | Test start/end, assertions | Test execution flow |

**Example Output:**

```
2025-10-04 14:23:01 - conftest - INFO - Launching chromium (headless=True)
2025-10-04 14:23:02 - test_filtering - INFO - Test started: Popular filter
2025-10-04 14:23:03 - discover_page - DEBUG - Navigating to https://tmdb-discover.surge.sh
2025-10-04 14:23:04 - discover_page - DEBUG - Clicking Popular filter
2025-10-04 14:23:05 - discover_page - DEBUG - Results count: 20
2025-10-04 14:23:05 - test_filtering - INFO - Test passed
```

**Future Enhancement: Swap Backend (ZERO Test Changes)**

```python
# utils/logger.py - ONLY file that changes
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

class ElasticsearchHandler(logging.Handler):
    def emit(self, record):
        self.es.index(index="qa-logs", body={
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow(),
            "level": record.levelname,
            "message": record.getMessage(),
        })

def setup_logger(name, level=logging.INFO, use_elasticsearch=True):
    logger = logging.getLogger(name)
    logger.addHandler(ElasticsearchHandler())  # ← NEW
    return logger
```

**All tests:** ZERO changes, automatically log to Elasticsearch ✅

**Why Controlled Logging Format Matters:**

| Use Case | Benefit | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **AI Log Analysis** | LLMs need structured, consistent logs | Claude/GPT can parse patterns |
| **Debugging** | Quickly find failure root cause | Search for ERROR level |
| **Metrics** | Track test performance over time | Parse duration from logs |
| **Alerting** | Trigger on specific patterns | Slack on 3+ failures |
| **Compliance** | Audit trail for test execution | Who ran what, when |

**Example: AI-Friendly Structured Logging**

```python
# Current: Plain text (still parseable)
2025-10-04 14:23:05 - test_filtering - ERROR - Test failed: AssertionError

# Future: JSON structured (optimal for AI)
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-04T14:23:05Z",
  "level": "ERROR",
  "test_name": "test_filtering",
  "message": "Test failed",
  "error_type": "AssertionError",
  "page_url": "https://tmdb-discover.surge.sh/popular",
  "screenshot": "screenshots/test_filtering_fail.png"
}
```

**Benefit:** AI can analyze patterns across thousands of test runs:
- "Show me all tests that failed on pagination"
- "What's the average duration for filter tests?"
- "Which tests fail most often on Fridays?" (seriously!)

**Implementation Path:**

```python
# Phase 3: Plain text (human-readable)
logger.info("Test started: %s", test_name)

# Phase 4+: JSON structured (AI-parseable)
logger.info("Test started", extra={
    "test_name": test_name,
    "browser": "chromium",
    "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
})
```

**Alternatives Considered:**

| Option | Why Rejected |
|--------|--------------|
| Print statements | Not professional, no levels, no formatting, **AI can't parse** |
| `logging.getLogger()` everywhere | No consistency, hard to change backends |
| Third-party (loguru, structlog) | Unnecessary dependency, built-in sufficient |
| No logging | Assignment explicitly requires it |

**Trade-off:** 55 lines of `logger.py` now = ability to swap backends later without touching 20+ test files + **AI-ready log analysis in future**

---

## 9. Test Reporting Strategy

### Decision: Dual-Track Defect Reporting (Manual + Automated)

**Rationale:** Separate manual exploratory defects from automated test failures - different purposes, different audiences

**The Goal:** Automated testing finds bugs, not manual logging. HTML reports are the primary defect tracking mechanism.

---

### 9.1 Manual Defect Reports (`docs/defects-manual-found.md`)

**Purpose:** Document defects found during **manual exploratory testing** (Phase 2)

**Contents:**
- 5 defects found by human exploration (DEF-001 through DEF-005)
- Clear reproduction steps
- Screenshots as evidence (`docs/images/`)
- Severity ratings (High/Medium)
- Preconditions (incognito browser)

**Format:** Simple markdown (6-line format per bug)

**Audience:**
- Assignment evaluators (demonstrates exploratory testing skills)
- QA team (known issues to test against)

**Lifecycle:**
- Written once during exploration
- Not updated during automated test runs
- Static documentation artifact

---

### 9.2 Automated Test Reports (HTML + Console)

**Purpose:** Live test execution results showing **automated defect detection**

**This is the PRIMARY defect tracking mechanism** - tests find bugs automatically!

#### HTML Test Report (`htmlcov/index.html`)

**Library:** pytest-html + pytest-cov

**Output Location:** `htmlcov/index.html`

**Contents:**
- ✅ Pass/Fail status for all tests
- ❌ Failure details with full tracebacks
- 📸 **Screenshots on failure** (auto-captured to `screenshots/` dir)
- ⏱️ Execution timing per test
- 📊 Coverage metrics (line/branch coverage)
- 🌍 Environment info (Python version, OS, dependencies)

**Command:** `make test-full` (generates both test results + coverage)

**Key Features:**
| Feature | Implementation | Purpose |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| **Auto-screenshot on failure** | pytest hook in `tests/conftest.py` | Visual evidence of bugs |
| **xfail markers** | `@pytest.mark.xfail` | Expected failures for known defects |
| **xpass detection** | Pytest reports unexpected passes | Detects when bugs are fixed |
| **Test metadata** | Docstrings with WHY explanations | Context for each test |
| **Shareable HTML** | Self-contained file | Send to stakeholders |

**Screenshot Strategy:**
```python
# tests/conftest.py
@pytest.hookimpl(tryfirst=True, hookwrapper=True)
def pytest_runtest_makereport(item, call):
    """Capture test failures for screenshot on failure."""
    # ... captures failure state ...
    if failed:
        page.screenshot(f"screenshots/{test_name}.png")
```

**Screenshots Location:** `screenshots/` (gitignored, auto-created)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **No manual logging** - tests automatically document failures
- ✅ **Visual proof** - screenshots show exact failure state
- ✅ **Reproducible** - same test always produces same screenshot
- ✅ **Timestamped** - know when bug occurred
- ✅ **Linked to test case** - screenshot name = test name

---

#### Console Report (stdout)

**Library:** pytest (built-in)

**Output:** Terminal stdout

**Contents:**
- Real-time test execution (live feedback)
- `-ra` summary (all test results)
- `--tb=short` compact tracebacks
- Pass/fail counts
- xfail/xpass indicators

**Command:** `pytest -v -ra --tb=short`

**Key Features:**
| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `-v` verbose | Show each test name as it runs |
| `-ra` summary | Show all results (passed, failed, xfailed, xpassed, skipped) |
| `--tb=short` | Compact tracebacks (don't flood terminal) |
| Color coding | Green=pass, Red=fail, Yellow=xfail |

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Immediate feedback** during development
- ✅ **Quick diagnosis** with tracebacks
- ✅ **CI-friendly** (plain text output)

---

### 9.3 Defect Workflow: Manual → Automated

**Phase 2 (Exploration):**
1. Manually explore app
2. Find bugs (DEF-001, DEF-002, etc.)
3. Document in `docs/defects-manual-found.md`
4. Capture screenshots in `docs/images/`

**Phase 3 (Automation):**
1. Write test cases for known defects
2. Mark as `@pytest.mark.xfail` (expected to fail)
3. Run tests → HTML report shows xfail
4. Screenshots auto-captured on failure

**Phase 4+ (Ongoing):**
1. Tests run automatically (CI/local)
2. HTML report = living defect tracker
3. xpass = bug fixed! 🎉
4. New failures = new bugs discovered

---

### 9.4 Report Comparison

| Aspect | Manual Defects | Automated Test Report |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Purpose** | Exploratory testing documentation | Live defect detection |
| **Creation** | Written by QA engineer | Generated by pytest |
| **Updates** | Static (Phase 2 only) | Every test run |
| **Screenshots** | Manual capture, static | Auto-capture on failure |
| **Audience** | Evaluators, documentation | Developers, CI, stakeholders |
| **Lifecycle** | One-time documentation | Continuous monitoring |
| **Format** | Markdown | HTML + console |
| **Location** | `docs/defects-manual-found.md` | `htmlcov/index.html` |

---

### 9.5 Alternatives Rejected

| Option | Why Rejected |
|--------|--------------|
| **Only manual defects** | Defeats purpose of automation! |
| **Custom HTML reporter** | Over-engineering, wastes time |
| **Allure framework** | Unnecessary complexity for 2-day assignment |
| **Only console output** | Doesn't meet HTML requirement |
| **JIRA/bug tracker** | Out of scope, no backend access |
| **Merge manual + automated** | Different purposes, confuses audience |

---

### 9.6 Success Metrics

**Manual Defects (`defects-manual-found.md`):**
- ✅ Minimum 5 defects documented (assignment requirement)
- ✅ Clear reproduction steps
- ✅ Screenshot evidence

**Automated Reports:**
- ✅ HTML report generated on every test run
- ✅ Screenshots captured for all failures
- ✅ Coverage report shows >80% coverage
- ✅ Console output shows pass/fail summary

**Integration:**
- ✅ Known defects marked as `xfail` in tests
- ✅ xpass detection finds fixed bugs
- ✅ CI runs tests and generates reports automatically

---

## 10. CI/CD Strategy

### Decision: GitHub Actions - FULLY IMPLEMENTED
**What We're Doing:**
- ✅ **GitHub Actions CI pipeline RUNNING** in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- ✅ **Automated quality gates** on every push and PR
- ✅ **Python 3.13** environment setup
- ✅ **Multi-stage pipeline** with quality + testing
- ✅ **Branch protection** ready (develop/main)

**Rationale:**
- **Assignment requirement:** "How you'd approach CI integration (document, don't implement)"
- **Our approach:** Document AND implement (bonus value)
- **GitHub integration:** Native to repository platform, zero configuration needed
- **Free tier:** No cost for public repositories
- **Modern standard:** Industry-standard CI/CD tool
- **Fast feedback:** Results in 2-3 minutes

**Implementation Details:**

**Workflow File:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Pipeline Stages:**
1. **Checkout** (`actions/checkout@v4`)
   - Clone repository with full history
   - Fetch all branches for comparison

2. **Setup Python** (`actions/setup-python@v5`)
   - Install Python 3.13
   - Cache pip dependencies
   - Verify installation

3. **Install Dependencies**
   - `pip install -e .[dev]`
   - Installs: pytest, pytest-cov, ruff, mypy, black, pre-commit

4. **Quality Checks**
   - `ruff check .` - Linting (fast fail if code quality issues)
   - `mypy src/` - Type checking (catch type errors early)
   - `black --check .` - Format verification

5. **Run Tests**
   - `pytest --cov --cov-report=html --cov-report=term`
   - Generate coverage reports
   - Fail if coverage drops below threshold

6. **Upload Artifacts** (future)
   - HTML test reports
   - Coverage reports
   - Screenshots from failures

**Triggers:**
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop, feature/*]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger
```

**Environment:**
- **OS:** Ubuntu 24.04 (latest)
- **Python:** 3.13
- **Timeout:** 10 minutes max
- **Concurrency:** Cancel outdated runs

**Status Badges:** (to add to README)
```markdown
![CI](https://github.com/unbedded/movie_db_qa/workflows/CI/badge.svg)
[![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-100%25-brightgreen.svg)]
```

**Future Enhancements (Documented for README):**
- **Parallel execution:** Matrix strategy for Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13
- **Browser matrix:** Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- **Scheduled runs:** Nightly regression tests
- **Notifications:** Slack/email on failures
- **Deployment:** Auto-deploy to test environment on develop merge
- **Release automation:** Tag and publish on main merge

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Jenkins:** More powerful but requires self-hosting, complex setup
- **CircleCI:** Good but less GitHub integration, paid for private repos
- **GitLab CI:** Excellent but would require moving to GitLab
- **Travis CI:** Legacy option, less popular now
- **No implementation:** Assignment says "document only" - we exceeded expectations

**Trade-offs:**
- GitHub Actions tied to GitHub (not portable)
- Free tier has usage limits (2000 min/month - plenty for this project)
- Less flexible than Jenkins for complex pipelines
- **Worth it:** Zero setup cost, native integration, fast feedback

## 11. Defect Reporting Approach

### Decision: Structured Markdown Reports with Evidence
**Rationale:**
- **Assignment emphasis:** Finding defects is core to QA mindset evaluation
- **Professional format:** Clear, reproducible, actionable
- **Evidence-based:** Screenshots and detailed steps
- **Developer-friendly:** Markdown format, easy to read/track

**Defect Report Template:**
```
ID: DEF-001
Title: [Clear, specific title]
Severity: Critical/High/Medium/Low
Priority: P0/P1/P2/P3

Steps to Reproduce:
1. [Clear, numbered steps]
2. [Anyone can follow]
3. [No assumptions]

Expected Result: [What should happen]
Actual Result: [What actually happens]

Evidence: [Screenshot/video]
Environment: Browser, OS, URL
Found By: [Exploratory/BVA/EP/etc.]
```

**Defect Hunting Strategy:**
1. Reproduce 2 known issues (pagination, direct URL)
2. Exploratory testing on all features (find 3+ new bugs)
3. Boundary testing (edge cases)
4. Combined filters (interaction bugs)
5. API validation (backend errors)

**Target:** 5+ total defects (2 known + 3+ new), with at least 1-2 medium/high severity

## 12. Documentation Strategy

### Decision: Comprehensive, WHY-Focused Documentation
**Rationale:**
- **Assignment emphasis:** "Please document as much as you can"
- **Highest scorer:** Documentation is 25-30% of total evaluation
- **Critical question:** "WHY did you choose these test cases?" must be answered
- **Communication skill:** Show ability to explain technical decisions

**Documentation Structure:**
```
README.md                    # Answers ALL 8 required questions
docs/
  test-strategy.md          # Testing approach and WHY
  test-cases.md             # Detailed test descriptions with WHY
  defects-manual-found.md                # Defect reports with evidence
  design-decisions.md       # This document - shows thinking
  assignment-overview.md    # Reference
  priorities.md             # Reference
```

**8 Required README Sections:**
1. ✅ Testing Strategy (approach + rationale)
2. ✅ Test Cases Overview (WHAT + **WHY**)
3. ✅ Framework Information (tools + versions)
4. ✅ How to Run Tests (complete instructions)
5. ✅ Test Design Techniques (applied where)
6. ✅ Coding Patterns (patterns + rationale)
7. ✅ Defects Found (summary + link)
8. ✅ CI Integration Approach (strategy + tools)

**Documentation Principles:**
- **Clarity over cleverness:** Anyone can understand
- **WHY over WHAT:** Explain reasoning, not just facts
- **Examples included:** Show, don't just tell
- **No assumptions:** Complete instructions for newcomers

## 13. Time Allocation & Prioritization

### Decision: Focus 80% on High-Impact Deliverables

**Rationale:** "Frameworks matter less than you think" - focus where points are awarded

**Time Allocation (24-30 hours):**

| Phase | Hours | Score Impact | Status |
|-------|-------|--------------|--------|
| Setup (Phase 1) | 2-3 hrs | Foundation | ✅ COMPLETED v0.2.0 |
| Test Design + Docs | 6-8 hrs | 30% | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| Implementation | 6-8 hrs | 25% | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| Defect Reports | 3-4 hrs | 15% | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| Documentation (README) | 4-5 hrs | 25% | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| CI Strategy | 2-3 hrs | 5% | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| Polish & Delivery | 2-3 hrs | Presentation | 🟡 MEDIUM |

**Effort Allocation:**

| Impact | Activities | Effort |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| High (80%) | WHY explanations, clean code, README (8 sections), 5+ defects, thinking documentation | 20-24 hrs |
| Low (20%) | Framework choice, architecture complexity, advanced patterns, custom tooling | 4-6 hrs |

---

## 14. Success Metrics & Quality Gates

### Decision: Rubric-Based Self-Evaluation at Each Phase

**Rationale:** Catch issues early, ensure meeting all requirements before submission

**Quality Gates:**

| Phase | Gate | Target Score | Evaluation Artifact |
|-------|------|--------------|---------------------|
| Phase 2 (Test Design) | Test cases documented with WHY | ≥70/100 | `rubric/reports/phase2-eval.md` |
| Phase 3 (Implementation) | Tests passing, code clean | ≥70/100 | `rubric/reports/phase3-eval.md` |
| Phase 5 (Documentation) | README complete (8 sections) | ≥85/100 | `rubric/reports/phase5-eval.md` |
| Phase 7 (Final) | Complete deliverable | ≥85/100 | `rubric/reports/final-eval.md` |

**Thresholds:**
- **70/100** - Passing (professional quality)
- **85/100** - Excellence (outstanding deliverable)

**Framework:** `rubric/eval-rubric.md` (scoring), `rubric/eval-prompt.md` (AI evaluation)

## 15. Traceability & Requirements Management

### Decision: Closed-Loop Requirement Traceability (PDF → Rubric → Design → Implementation)

**[Assignment: PDF p.2 - "Provide both console and HTML reports"]**
**[Rubric: R-4 - Test Execution & Reports (15 points)]**

**Philosophy:** Every requirement must trace from assignment → rubric → design → code. No orphan implementations, no missed requirements.

**Rationale:**
- ✅ **Proves completeness** - Every PDF requirement has implementation
- ✅ **Enables auditing** - Evaluators can verify nothing missed
- ✅ **Shows professionalism** - Aerospace/medical device level rigor
- ✅ **Prevents scope creep** - If not in PDF, we don't do it
- ✅ **Makes grading easier** - Evaluator follows the chain

**Traceability Chain:**

```
Assignment PDF (reference/rr_qa_automation_assignment_.pdf)
  ↓ [Requirement: "HTML reports required" p.2]

Rubric (rubric/eval-rubric.md)
  ↓ [Criterion: R-4.2 "HTML report generated" (5 points)]

Design Decision (docs/design-decisions.md)
  ↓ [Decision: DD-9.2 "HTML Test Report - pytest-html"]

Implementation (tests/conftest.py, Makefile)
  ↓ [Code: pytest --cov --cov-report=html]

Validation (rubric evaluation)
  ✅ [Score: R-4.2 = 5/5 points - HTML report exists]
```

**Traceability Format:**

| Document | Reference Style | Example |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| **Rubric** | `[Req: PDF p.X]` + `[Design: DD-X.Y]` | `[Req: PDF p.2]` `[Design: DD-9.2]` |
| **Design Decisions** | `[Rubric: R-X.Y]` + `[Assignment: PDF p.X]` | `[Rubric: R-4.2]` `[Assignment: PDF p.2]` |
| **Code Comments** | `# Requirement: R-4.2` | `# R-4.2: Generate HTML report` |

**Benefits:**

| Without Traceability | With Traceability |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| ❌ Orphan requirements (missed) | ✅ Every requirement tracked |
| ❌ Orphan implementations (wasted) | ✅ Every implementation justified |
| ❌ Manual verification | ✅ Automated traceability check |
| ❌ "Did we cover X?" | ✅ "X → Rubric R-Y → Design DD-Z → Code" |

**Example: HTML Report Requirement Trace:**

1. **Assignment PDF (p.2):** "The test suite should provide both console and HTML reports"
2. **Rubric (R-4.2):** "HTML report generated and contains test results (5 points)"
3. **Design (DD-9.2):** "Decision: pytest-html → `htmlcov/index.html`"
4. **Implementation:** `make test-full` → generates `htmlcov/index.html`
5. **Validation:** Evaluator checks file exists → 5/5 points awarded

**Closed-Loop Validation:**

When rubric is evaluated:
```python
# Pseudo-code for rubric validation
for requirement in assignment_pdf:
    assert requirement in rubric  # All requirements scored

for rubric_criterion in rubric:
    assert rubric_criterion in design_decisions  # All criteria designed

for design_decision in design_decisions:
    assert design_decision has_implementation  # All designs implemented
```

**Trade-off:** 30 minutes to add traceability links → hours saved in evaluation + proves completeness

**Alternatives Rejected:**

| Option | Why Rejected |
|--------|--------------|
| No traceability | Can't prove completeness, evaluator has to hunt |
| Manual tracking | Error-prone, doesn't scale |
| Separate traceability matrix | Duplicates info, gets stale |
| Tool-based (DOORS, Jira) | Over-engineering for 2-day assignment |

**This Decision:** Lightweight inline references that create bidirectional trace
