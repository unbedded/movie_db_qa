## Notes

**Assignment Context:**
> "We've kept the scope of the assignment rather small on purpose. Please document as much as you can."

**Key Focus:**
- **WHY** you chose this approach
- **Risk-based** prioritization
- **Coverage** rationale (what's tested and what's not)
- **Techniques** applied and where
