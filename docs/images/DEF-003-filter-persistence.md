# DEF-003: Filter Lost After Pagination - Screenshot Note

**Defect:** Popular filter clears when navigating to page 2

**Status:** This defect shows XPASS in test results - may have been fixed by the application!

```python
@pytest.mark.xfail(reason="DEF-003: Filter lost after pagination")
def test_tc_pag_003_filter_persistence_across_pagination(self, page: Page) -> None:
    """TC-PAG-003: Filter Persistence Across Pagination."""
```

**Test Result:** XPASS (expected to fail but passed!)

This suggests the application may have fixed this bug, or the defect is intermittent.

**Evidence Location:** 
- Test: tests/test_foundation.py line 249
- Defect Doc: docs/defects-manual-found.md line 68
