## Important Reminders

**Assignment Emphasis:**
> "Which cases did you generate? And **WHY?**"

**Key Success Factors:**
1. âœ… **Creative test scenarios** - Not just obvious happy paths
2. âœ… **Clear WHY explanations** - Justify every test case
3. âœ… **Step-by-step clarity** - Anyone can execute
4. âœ… **Test design techniques** - Show systematic approach
5. âœ… **Edge cases & negative tests** - QA mindset

**Scoring Weight:** Test case design + WHY documentation = **30% of total score**

---

**Status:** This document will be completed during Phase 2: Test Design & Documentation.

**Next Steps:**
1. Manually explore https://tmdb-discover.surge.sh/ (30 min)
2. Map all filtering options and behaviors
3. Apply test design techniques (BVA, EP, Decision Tables)
4. Document test cases with clear WHY explanations
5. Find and document defects during exploration
