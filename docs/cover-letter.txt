Subject: QA Automation Assignment Submission - movie_db_qa

Dear Rapyuta Robotics Team,

Please find my QA automation assignment submission at:
https://github.com/unbedded/movie_db_qa

Timeline: ~15-20 hours total effort over several sessions

I leverage AI-augmented workflows (Claude Code) to accelerate development - similar to how modern developers use GitHub Copilot. The key differentiator is what you BUILD with those tools, not the tools themselves.

What sets this submission apart - I went BEYOND the assignment requirements:

- REQUIREMENTS ELICITATION FROM SCRATCH - Most candidates test against provided specs. I reverse-engineered the application behavior, documented 17 requirements in docs/requirements.md, structured them as machine-readable YAML (rubric/requirements.yml), then built full traceability linking requirements → design → tests → artifacts. See artifacts/rubric-reports/req-traceability-report.md for the complete trace matrix.
- GITFLOW + SEMANTIC VERSIONING - Full release management (CHANGELOG, VERSION, w/ quality commit comments)
- PRE-COMMIT HOOKS - Quality gates locally enforced (ruff, mypy, black) - actually configured, not aspirational
- CI/CD PIPELINE - GitHub Actions running full test suite + quality checks on every push (passing ✅)
- XFAIL TESTS - Auto-capture screenshots of actual defects (not just broken tests)
- RUBRIC-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT - Self-evaluation at each phase (artifacts/rubric-reports/ shows 78→84→91→95/100 progression)
- TODO.md DEVELOPMENT JOURNAL - Complete timeline history showing phase-by-phase progression (v0.1.0 → v1.3.0, 6 phases)

I'm confident in my core coding skills and welcome any pure coding assessment or technical interview to validate my capabilities.

Where to start:
- artifacts/qa-reports/index.html - Test execution results
- artifacts/rubric-reports/phase6-rubric-eval.md - Self-evaluation (95/100)
- All git branches preserved on remote for evaluation transparency

Thank you for the opportunity. I look forward to discussing this work and demonstrating my QA automation expertise.

Best regards,
 Spencer Barrett
