## üì¶ TECHNICAL DEBT & DEFERRED ITEMS

### ‚úÖ Implemented (Demonstrable Proof)

| Feature | Implementation Location |
|---------|------------------------|
| PEP8 + Type Hints + 100% Coverage | `Makefile` + `.pre-commit-config.yaml` + `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |
| Git-Flow Workflow | Branch protection (`develop` + `main`), feature branches required |
| Quality Gates | `make quality` (ruff + mypy + black) |
| CI/CD Pipeline | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (quality ‚Üí tests on push/PR) |
| Test Framework | `pyproject.toml` (pytest ‚â•7.0, pytest-cov ‚â•4.0) |

### üîÑ Deferred (Post-Submission)

| Item | Reason | Effort |
|------|--------|--------|
| Browser Library (Selenium/Playwright) | Choice pending Phase 3 implementation | 30 min |
| API Validation (comprehensive) | UI behavior priority, 1-2 examples only | 2-3 hrs |
| Extended Test Scope | Foundation = 8-10 tests, defer Type/Metadata filters | 6 hrs (15+ tests) |
| Cross-Browser Matrix | Chrome only, not Firefox/Safari/Edge | 1-2 hrs |

### ‚ùå Out of Scope (Won't Do)

| Item | Reason | Effort |
|------|--------|--------|
| Mobile/Accessibility/Performance | Not assignment requirements | 10+ hrs |

| Advanced POM | Simple 1-2 page classes sufficient | 3-4 hrs |
| Parallel Execution | Small suite, sequential acceptable | 1 hr |

**Expansion Effort:** 20-30 hrs for 90-95/100 vs 1.5 days for 70-80/100

---

## üí° FOUNDATION STRATEGY - 1.5 DAYS

### Critical Path (Must Do - 12-16 hours)
1. ‚úÖ **Phase 2 (3-4 hrs):** Document 8-10 test cases with WHY + CI fix
2. ‚úÖ **Phase 3 (4-5 hrs):** Implement those 8-10 tests - WORKING
3. ‚úÖ **Phase 4 (1.5-2 hrs):** Find and document 5 defects with evidence
4. ‚úÖ **Phase 5 (2-3 hrs):** README answers ALL 8 questions
5. ‚úÖ **Phase 6 (1-2 hrs):** Polish, CI GREEN, professional delivery

### High-Impact Actions (Do These!)
1. ‚≠ê **Explain WHY** for every test case (30% of score)
2. ‚≠ê **Complete README** with all 8 sections (25% of score)
3. ‚≠ê **Find 5+ defects** with clear evidence (15% of score)
4. ‚≠ê **Clean code** that runs end-to-end (25% of score)
5. ‚≠ê **CI GREEN** on GitHub

### Time Savers (Don't Over-Engineer!)
1. Use pytest-html (built-in) - don't build custom reporter
2. Use Python logging (built-in) - don't add loguru
3. Simple Page Object (1-2 files) - don't build framework
4. 8-10 tests first - expand later if time
5. Reference docs/design-decisions.md - don't re-explain everything

### If You Get Stuck (Time Limits!)
- Exploration stuck? ‚Üí 30 min max, document what you found
- Test case design stuck? ‚Üí Focus on Critical/High only
- Implementation stuck? ‚Üí Skip hard tests, do simple ones first
- Can't find 5 defects? ‚Üí Known issues + boundary tests + search edge cases
- README stuck? ‚Üí Use design-decisions.md as source material

## üéØ REMEMBER

**The Real Evaluation Criteria:**
1. Can you design good tests? (Strategy + Cases)
2. Can you write clean code? (Maintainability)
3. Can you communicate? (Documentation)
4. Can you find defects? (QA mindset)
5. Can you think strategically? (CI approach)

**NOT being evaluated on:**
- Framework complexity
- Advanced patterns
- Cutting-edge tech
- Volume of tests

**Success = Working tests + Clear thinking + Good documentation**

Pick familiar tools, write clean code, document thoroughly, find bugs, explain your thinking.

**Less is more when it's clean, clear, and complete.**
