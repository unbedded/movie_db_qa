**Note:** Old `feature/update-todo` branch had CI issues at commit `fb84905`, but this branch includes the fix

**Success Metric:** Foundation test suite runs end-to-end successfully

---

## <span style="color:green">v0.4.0: API Validation & Technical Debt</span>
**Branch:** `feature/test-api-and-debt` (commit 5104f12)
**Goal:** Complete missing assignment requirement (API validation) + low-risk cleanup items
**Time Spent:** 1.5 hours
**Achievement:** API validation implemented - Assignment requirement R-5.3 satisfied!

### PRIORITY 1: API Validation (ASSIGNMENT REQUIREMENT)  DONE
**Gap:** Rubric R-5.3 - "Missing API validation" → lose 3-4 points
**Assignment PDF Page 2:** "Usage of browser APIs calls and how you are asserting them"

- [x] Add Playwright network interception to conftest.py
  - [x] Create fixture to capture network requests
  - [x] Filter for TMDB API calls (api.themoviedb.org)

**Why:** Shows complete error reporting pipeline (logs + HTML + screenshots)

- [x] Temporarily break TC-FLT-CAT-001 test
- [x] Run test to generate failure screenshot
- [x] Copy screenshot to `docs/images/example-test-failure-screenshot.png`
- [x] Revert test to passing state
- [x] Update README: Add screenshot capture section with example
- [x] Add comment in conftest.py explaining screenshot trigger conditions

### PRIORITY 3: Magic Numbers Cleanup  DONE
**Gap:** Hardcoded values in test_foundation.py (violates CLAUDE.md standards)

- [x] Move to `src/movie_db_qa/utils/config.py`:
  - [x] `expected_results_per_page = 20`
  - [x] Remove duplicate `BASE_URL` from test_foundation.py (use config.base_url)
- [x] Update test_foundation.py to import from config
- [x] Verify tests still pass

### PRIORITY 4: CI Fix  DONE
**Gap:** GitHub Actions CI failing - Playwright browsers not installed
**Why:** Evaluators need to see CI pipeline GREEN

- [x] Add `playwright install --with-deps chromium` to .github/workflows/ci.yml
- [x] Ready to push and verify CI passes

###  Phase Gate 4: Requirements Complete - ALL DONE

  - [x] TMDB endpoints validated: `/movie/popular`, `/trending/movie/week`, page parameters
- [x]  Screenshot capture demonstrated
  - [x] Example screenshot: `docs/images/example-test-failure-screenshot.png`
  - [x] Auto-capture working (pytest hook verified)
- [x]  Magic numbers eliminated
  - [x] `config.base_url` and `config.expected_results_per_page` in config.py
  - [x] All hardcoded values removed from test_foundation.py
- [x]  All tests passing (2 pass, 4 xfail, 1 xpass, 1 skip)
- [x]  Quality checks pass (ruff, mypy, black)
- [x]  CI fix added (playwright install --with-deps chromium)
- [x]  Documentation updated (README + test-strategy.md with API validation sections)
- [x]  **Rubric Re-evaluation: 84/100** - achieved +6 points from Phase 3 (78→84) via API validation

**Success Metric:** All explicit assignment requirements satisfied

## v1.1.0: Traceability Infrastructure (FUTURE)
**Branch:** Will create `feature/traceability` from develop (after v1.0.0)
**Goal:** Implement automated traceability (the paradigm shift)
**Design Doc:** docs/ai-qa-testing.md
**Rubric Target:** 87-90/100 (Excellence)
**Time Budget:** 2-3 hours

### Context: The Paradigm Shift
From docs/ai-qa-testing.md - "Same ~15-20 hour effort, but with **provable completeness** instead of **hoped-for coverage**"

Traditional QA deliverable:
- Manual traceability (hope nothing missed)
- Evaluator hunts for evidence (30 min)
- "I think I got everything"

AI-powered QA deliverable:
- `make audit` proves requirements → design → tests → artifacts
- Evaluator runs validation (2 min)
- Machine-verified completeness

### PRIORITY 1: Structured Requirements (1 hour)
- [ ] Create `requirements.yml` (structured data)
  - [ ] Convert docs/requirements.md to YAML format
  - [ ] Add traceability fields: source (PDF page), rubric (R-X), design (DD-X), artifacts (paths)
  - [ ] Example structure from ai-qa-testing.md:
    ```yaml
    REQ-001:
      desc: "HTML test report required"
      source: "PDF p.2"
      rubric: "R-5"
      design: "DD-9.2"
      artifacts: ["htmlcov/index.html"]
    ```

### PRIORITY 2: Automated Audit Script (1 hour)
- [ ] Create `scripts/audit_requirements.py`
  - [ ] Load requirements.yml
  - [ ] Validate design doc references (grep for [REQ-XXX] tags)
  - [ ] Validate artifacts exist (Path checks)
  - [ ] Detect orphaned implementations (tests without requirements)
  - [ ] Report: "✅ All 15 requirements validated" or fail with gaps

### PRIORITY 3: Makefile Integration (30 min)
- [ ] Add `make audit` target
  - [ ] Run scripts/audit_requirements.py
  - [ ] Exit code 0 = pass, 1 = fail
  - [ ] CI: Add audit to workflow (fail build if gaps)
- [ ] Add `make rubric-eval` target (optional)
  - [ ] AI-powered rubric scoring from eval-rubric.md
  - [ ] Output: "📊 Rubric score: 87/100 (Excellent)"

### PRIORITY 4: Documentation Update (30 min)
- [ ] Update README with validation section
  - [ ] Explain `make audit` workflow
  - [ ] Show evaluator how to verify completeness (2 min vs 30 min)
- [ ] Update design-decisions.md
  - [ ] Add section on AI-powered validation approach
  - [ ] Reference docs/ai-qa-testing.md

### Phase Gate v1.1.0
- [ ] requirements.yml created (machine-readable)
- [ ] `make audit` passes (all requirements traced)
- [ ] No orphaned implementations
- [ ] No missing artifacts
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Rubric re-evaluation: target 87-90/100

**Success Metric:** `make audit` proves nothing missed - paradigm shift delivered

**Key Innovation:** Treating requirements as structured data enables AI to validate the entire test design chain automatically.

**Value Proposition:**
- Same 15-20 hour effort
- Provable completeness (not hope)
- 2 hours invested in automation = evaluator saves 30 min + confidence boost

---

## v1.2.0: Final Polish & Delivery (FUTURE)
**Branch:** Will create `feature/polish` after Phase 4 complete
**Goal:** Clean, professional deliverable
**Time Budget:** 1-2 hours MAX

### PRIORITY 1: Quality Verification (30 min)  DO FIRST
- [ ] Run `make quality` - Fix all Ruff/MyPy issues
- [ ] Run `make test-full` 2-3 times - Verify stable
- [ ] Check HTML report looks professional
- [ ] Check console output is clear
- [ ] Verify CI is GREEN on GitHub

### PRIORITY 2: Code Cleanup (30 min)  DO SECOND
- [ ] Remove any debug code, print statements
- [ ] Clean up comments (keep useful, remove clutter)
- [ ] Verify consistent naming throughout
- [ ] Check no unused imports/dependencies

### PRIORITY 3: Documentation Final Check (30 min)  DO THIRD
- [ ] Proofread README - fix typos
- [ ] Test ALL commands in README work
- [ ] Verify all links work (docs/, rubric/)
- [ ] Check all 8 sections present and complete

### PRIORITY 4: Delivery (30 min)  FINAL STEP
- [ ] Review git history - meaningful commits
- [ ] Merge to develop
- [ ] Create release branch from develop
- [ ] Tag and release to main (if ready)
- [ ] Verify repo is public
- [ ] Final verification: Clone fresh and run tests

### Phase Gate v1.2.0: Final Delivery Check
- [ ] All foundation tests PASS
- [ ] All documentation COMPLETE (8 sections)
- [ ] Minimum 5 defects documented
- [ ] CI pipeline GREEN
- [ ] Repo clean and professional
- [ ] README comprehensive
- [ ] Can clone fresh and run successfully
- [ ] **Final Rubric Evaluation (target: 85-90/100)**

**Success Metric:** Professional, complete FOUNDATION deliverable ready for review

**IF TIME REMAINS - EXPAND:**
- Add more test cases (Medium priority)
- Find additional defects (beyond 5)
- Enhance documentation
- Add more exploratory tests
- Improve test coverage

### Future Enhancement: CI Report Archival (Post-v0.3.0)
- [ ] GitHub Actions: Upload test reports as CI artifacts
- [ ] Version reports by commit SHA (automatic)
- [ ] Add download links to README
- [ ] Keep `report/` and `htmlcov/` gitignored (regenerate fresh)
- [ ] Sample reports in `docs/reports/` show baseline

**Implementation:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
- name: Archive test reports
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: test-reports-${{ github.sha }}
    path: |
      report/
      htmlcov/
```

### Future Enhancement: Demonstrate Screenshot Capture (Post-v0.3.0)
**Goal:** Show screenshot-on-failure artifact collection works

**Why:** Currently `screenshots/` is empty because no unexpected failures occurred (xfail tests don't trigger screenshot hook). Adding sample demonstrates the feature works.

**Options:**
1. **Temporarily break a passing test** → run → capture screenshot → revert
2. **Add commented-out test with intentional failure** → documentation example
3. **Add sample screenshot to docs/** → `docs/images/example-test-failure.png`
4. **Update README** → explain when/how screenshots are captured

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Add sample failure screenshot to `docs/images/`
- [ ] Update README section on screenshot capture
- [ ] Add code comment in conftest.py explaining trigger conditions
- [ ] Consider: Add one test WITHOUT xfail to demonstrate live failure capture

**Value:** Shows evaluator the full error reporting pipeline (logs + HTML + screenshots)

## 📦 TECHNICAL DEBT & DEFERRED ITEMS

###  Implemented (Demonstrable Proof)

| Feature | Implementation Location |
|---------|------------------------|
| PEP8 + Type Hints + 100% Coverage | `Makefile` + `.pre-commit-config.yaml` + `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |
| Git-Flow Workflow | Branch protection (`develop` + `main`), feature branches required |
| Quality Gates | `make quality` (ruff + mypy + black) |
| CI/CD Pipeline | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (quality → tests on push/PR) |
| Test Framework | `pyproject.toml` (pytest ≥7.0, pytest-cov ≥4.0) |

### 🔄 Deferred (Post-Submission)

| Item | Reason | Effort |
|------|--------|--------|
| AI Traceability System | Innovation feature, not assignment requirement | 2-3 hrs |
| Extended Test Scope | Foundation = 8-10 tests, defer Type/Metadata filters | 6 hrs (15+ tests) |
| Cross-Browser Matrix | Chrome only, not Firefox/Safari/Edge | 1-2 hrs |
| Comprehensive API Validation | 2-3 examples sufficient for assignment | 2-3 hrs |

###  Out of Scope (Won't Do)

| Item | Reason | Effort |
|------|--------|--------|
| Mobile/Accessibility/Performance | Not assignment requirements | 10+ hrs |
| Data Accuracy Validation | No backend access, cannot verify TMDB API | N/A |
| Advanced POM | Simple 1-2 page classes sufficient | 3-4 hrs |
| Parallel Execution | Small suite, sequential acceptable | 1 hr |

**Expansion Effort:** 20-30 hrs for 90-95/100 vs 1.5 days for 70-80/100

---

## 💡 FOUNDATION STRATEGY - 1.5 DAYS

### Critical Path (Must Do - 12-16 hours)
1.  **Phase 2 (3-4 hrs):** Document 8-10 test cases with WHY + CI fix
2.  **Phase 3 (4-5 hrs):** Implement those 8-10 tests - WORKING
3.  **Phase 4 (1.5-2 hrs):** Find and document 5 defects with evidence
4.  **Phase 5 (2-3 hrs):** README answers ALL 8 questions
5.  **Phase 6 (1-2 hrs):** Polish, CI GREEN, professional delivery

### High-Impact Actions (Do These!)
1. ⭐ **Explain WHY** for every test case (30% of score)
2. ⭐ **Complete README** with all 8 sections (25% of score)
3. ⭐ **Find 5+ defects** with clear evidence (15% of score)
4. ⭐ **Clean code** that runs end-to-end (25% of score)
5. ⭐ **CI GREEN** on GitHub

### Time Savers (Don't Over-Engineer!)
1. Use pytest-html (built-in) - don't build custom reporter
2. Use Python logging (built-in) - don't add loguru
3. Simple Page Object (1-2 files) - don't build framework
4. 8-10 tests first - expand later if time
5. Reference docs/design-decisions.md - don't re-explain everything

### If You Get Stuck (Time Limits!)
- Exploration stuck? → 30 min max, document what you found
- Test case design stuck? → Focus on Critical/High only
- Implementation stuck? → Skip hard tests, do simple ones first
- Can't find 5 defects? → Known issues + boundary tests + search edge cases
- README stuck? → Use design-decisions.md as source material

## 🎯 REMEMBER

**The Real Evaluation Criteria:**
1. Can you design good tests? (Strategy + Cases)
2. Can you write clean code? (Maintainability)
3. Can you communicate? (Documentation)
4. Can you find defects? (QA mindset)
5. Can you think strategically? (CI approach)

**NOT being evaluated on:**
- Framework complexity
- Advanced patterns
- Cutting-edge tech
- Volume of tests

**Success = Working tests + Clear thinking + Good documentation**

Pick familiar tools, write clean code, document thoroughly, find bugs, explain your thinking.

**Less is more when it's clean, clear, and complete.**
